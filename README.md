# Javascript Position
In this example, as the user scrolls down the page, a box slides into view if they get within 500 pixels of the footer. We will call this part of the page the end zone, and you need to work out the height at which the endZone starts. Every time the user scrolls, you then check the position of the scroll bar from the top of the page.
